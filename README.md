# NFLDeepDive
NFL Stat Deepdiver is a Python/Tkinter desktop app for exploring season-level NFL passing data. It scrapes Pro-Football-Reference, caches results, cleans/merges rows, and computes z-scores to compare players relative to their peers. Columns are sortable, and the layout adapts to pre/post-QBR eras.
